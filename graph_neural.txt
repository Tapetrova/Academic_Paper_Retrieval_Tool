1. Neural Network Spectral Robustness Under Perturbations of the Underlying Graph (2016)
Cites count: 37
Recent studies have been using graph-theoretical approaches to model complex networks (such as social, infrastructural, or biological networks) and how their hardwired circuitry relates to their dynamic evolution in time. Understanding how configuration reflects on the coupled behavior in a system of dynamic nodes can be of great importance, for example, in the context of how the brain connectome is affecting brain function. However, the effect of connectivity patterns on network dynamics is far from being fully understood.

2. Power System Network Topology Identification Based on Knowledge Graph and Graph Neural Network (2021)
Cites count: 11
The automatic identification of the topology of power networks is important for the data-driven and situation-aware operation of power grids. Traditional methods of topology identification lack a data-tolerant mechanism, and the accuracy of their performance in terms of identification is thus affected by the quality of data. Topology identification is related to the link prediction problem.

Abstract Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been instrumental in mitigating the challenges of cold start and data scarcity in recommender systems, serving as a kind of auxiliary information. However, recent studies reveal that KGs, while beneficial, may also inadvertently furnish malicious attackers with more comprehensive background knowledge, escalating the risk of user privacy data breaches within these recommender systems.

AbstractBackgroundTranscriptomic profiles have become crucial information in understanding diseases and improving treatments. While dysregulated gene sets are identified via pathway analysis, various machine learning models have been proposed for predicting phenotypes such as disease type and drug response based on gene expression patterns.

AbstractMotivationDespite the advances in sequencing technology, massive proteins with known sequences remain functionally unannotated. Biological network alignment (NA), which aims to find the node correspondence between species’ protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, has been a popular strategy to uncover missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge across species. Traditional NA methods assumed that topologically similar proteins in PPIs are functionally similar.

Abstract With the development of the Internet in recent years, the network information is exploding, people have entered the era of big data, from the lack of information in the past to the great information overload nowadays. It has become an important challenge to filter the information that is beneficial to you in the ocean of information on the Internet. As a subset of the information filtering system, the recommendation system mainly relies on the historical interaction records of users products and its own attribute information to explore the potential preferences and needs of users, which greatly reduces the time for users to filter information and is helpful for improving user experience and alleviating the information overload problem.

AbstractThe biological function of natural non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) is tightly bound to their molecular structure. Sequence analyses such as multiple sequence alignments (MSA) are the bread and butter of bio-molecules functional analysis; however, analyzing sequence and structure simultaneously is a difficult task. In this work, we propose CARNAGE (Clustering/Alignment of RNA with Graph-network Embedding), which leverages a graph neural network encoder to imprint structural information into a sequence-like embedding; therefore, downstream sequence analyses now account implicitly for structural constraints.

AbstractThe immune repertoire is a collection of immune receptors that has emerged as an important biomarker for both the diagnostic and therapeutic of cancer patients. In terms of deep learning, analyzing immune repertoire is a challenging multiple-instance learning problem in which the immune repertoire of an individual is a bag, and the immune receptor is an instance. Although several deep learning methods for immune repertoire analysis are introduced, they consider the immune repertoire as a set-like structure that doesn’t take into account the nature of the immune response.
